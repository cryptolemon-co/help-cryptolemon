## FAQs

1. **Why did my transaction fail?**
   Transaction failure could be due to network congestion or insufficient wallet balance. Ensure your wallet has enough SOL and try again.

2. **Will fees be deducted if the transaction fails?**
   No. Fees and bundled operations are executed together—either both succeed, or neither is charged.

3. **Will partial transactions fail?**
   No. Bundled operations rely on the Jito tool, meaning either all wallets succeed together, or all fail together.
